# OposParser
  
This project provides a small AddIn for Excel to allow the selection
of entries according to the following process:

- Columns containing a certain string might be highlighted
- Columns before/after a certain date might be highlighted
- Highlight columns whose summed total exceeds a certain value.
  Also possible: whose multiplied total exceeds a certain value.

Why would this be useful?

This project is mainly used by an accounting firm that needs an easily
access interface to those operations in Excel.
